This repo contains the scripts our team used for this project. It contains the training scripts of two models: VAE and GAN.

To run the models, you need to download the [Piano](http://deepyeti.ucsd.edu/cdonahue/wavegan/data/mancini_piano.tar.gz) dataset.


To run the GAN model:

``` python3 GANs.py```

The VAE model was implemented in jupyter notebook and one can run the VAE following the scripts in the notebook.
